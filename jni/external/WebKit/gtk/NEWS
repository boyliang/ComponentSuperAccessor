WebKitGTK+ 1.1.12
=================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.12?

  - Fix WebKitSoupAuthDialog to only save passwords in gnome-keyring
    (if enabled) when authentication succeeds.
  - Implement a proper size_request method for WebKitWebView. The
    widget will request the size of the whole page as its size
    requisition.
  - Many a11y improvements.
  - The usual amount of other misc fixes.
  - WEBKIT_DEBUG variable now accepts channel names in any case
    again.

=================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.11
=================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.11?

  - WebKit has got a new feature - a XSS auditor, that should improve
    security; this feature is still experimental, and disabled by
    default, but applications can enable it using the setting.
  - The hackish content sniffing code that was beig used to avoid
    pages requesting downloads instead of displaying content has been
    replaced by usage of a new Soup feature, which implements proper
    content sniffing.
  - More accessibility work, including fixes for problems which were
    critical for a possible GNOME 2.28 release.
  - Pasting rich text from other browsers should now work as expected.
  - The usual amount of misc fixes.

=================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.10
=================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.10?

  - WebKitNetworkRequest has now GObject properties for its URI and
    the SoupMessage that backs it up.
  - Fix AtkText methods get_selection and get_n_selections to not use
    the global selection but only the selection that belongs to the
    object being used.
  - Fix a crasher when emitting the a11y signal 'text-caret-moved' in
    some situations with debug builds.

================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.9
================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.9?

  - Scrolling once again received a lot of love, and many subtle
    problems and bugs were killed, and we now get correct behavior in
    acid2; a number of smaller improvements are in the queue.
  - Accessibility keeps gaining better support. On this release a lot
    of work was done on the AtkText interface implementation.
  - WebKitNetworkRequest now carries with it all the information
    regarding the request, not only the URI. This means you will no
    longer miss headers such as Referer when passing NetworkRequest
    objects from a callback to webkit_web_frame_load_request.

================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.8
================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.8?

  - We found out that WebKitWebHistoryItems were being kept with a
    reference count of 2 instead of 1 as they should; nobody should be
    relying on that, but if you hit reference counting problems with
    items you were creating yourself, this is for you.
  - You can now copy images from the web page to the clipboard.
  - Improvements were made to the Plugin handling code.
  - Scroll events will now be correctly reported to web applications.
  - You can now embed arbitrary widgets as if it was a plugin, with
    the new "create-plugin-widget" signal.
  - The atk_text_get_text_{at,after,before}_offset methods are now
    implemented for all boundary types except LINE_AFTER and
    LINE_BEFORE.
  - The usual stream of minor fixes and improvements, as always.

================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.7
================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.7?

  - This release includes a security fix:
    SVGList::insertItemBefore would not perform a bounds check on the
    index it was provided, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.
  - New frame loading properties supersede various load-* signals, and
    are also accessible in the WebView, for convenience, making this
    API saner.
  - JIT is now supported for X86-64 on Linux, and enabled by default!
  - A regression on webkit_web_view_load_string has been fixed, making
    it work correctly again when the document uses encodings which may
    use more than 1 byte per character.
  - Yet more work has been done to the ATK support, caret browsing
    support improvements in particular.
  - Filenames suggested by the Download functionality now correctly
    use the filename given by the host, if available.
  - Build fixes for IA64, and AMD64
  - gtk-doc support has also improved, and you should now be able to
    cd WebKit/gtk/docs and type make docs, if you --enable-gtk-doc on
    configure, as long as you build  with srcdir == builddir.
  - More crashes and other bugs fixed, and small improvements made
    under the hood.

================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.6
================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.6?

  - Several ATK support additions and fixes got landed, with many
    roles being now implemented, providing better accessibility.
  - Caret browsing is now available.
  - Spelling check has been implemented using Enchant; the API is
    still lacking, and some of the functionality still needs to be
    improved, though.
  - Error reporting is now available, with default error pages, and
    API that allows the application to override the default behavior;
    localization of those pages is still not supported, but planned.
  - More crashes and other bugs fixed.

================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.5
================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.5?

  - Added gtk-doc support to the build system. It is not fully
    integrated yet, so some manual tweaking is still needed.
  - Minimum required GTK+ version is now 2.10.
  - Added l10n support with gettext. Translations are stored in
    WebKit/gtk/po/.
  - Many improvements to the ATK support. It's good enough to provide
    a basic user experience with Accerciser now, but we'll keep
    improving it in further releases.
  - New printing API that allows applications to control and monitor
    the printing process, when requested by javascript or started by
    the user.
  - Many bugfixes.

================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.4
================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.4?

  - WebKitWebView gained uri and title properties, deprecating the
    usage of the title-changed signal.
  - Basic functionality for HTML5 media tags has been achieved; there
    are many unimplented methods, and rough edges still, though.
  - Font rendering received quite some love, with layouting, and
    memory handling fixes, and at least one less crash.
  - A new signal, new-window-policy-decision-requested, has been added
    to WebKitWebView, that makes it possible for the application to
    correctly decide what to do when new windows are requested.
  - A bug that made tooltips for consecutive links not update their
    location was fixed.
  - Several improvements were made to the HTTP backend, including
    making it more robust when talking to servers which send bad
    Content-Type headers.
  - WebKitWebView now uses the GtkBinding system to handle key events,
    which means that the user is now able to customize the keys used
    for various operations, and that many subtle bugs have been fixed.

================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.3
================

The 1.1.3 release was just a quick bug fix release, because we made a
mistake in library versioning.

================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.2
================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.2?

  - Added support for downloads: a new signal, 'download-requested',
    will be emitted by WebKit when a dowload is requested. On top of
    that, the download process has been encapsulated in a new object,
    WebKitDownload, which allows the user to control it or to start
    new downloads from the client side.
  - Added webkit_web_view_get_encoding to get the automatic encoding
    of the current page.
  - Added GObject properties for 'encoding' and 'custom-encoding'.
  - Added 'javascript-profiling-enabled' property to the WebInspector,
    which allows to enable and disable the profiling functionality.
  - Added API to create and add history items to WebKit's history.
  - Improved debugging support with WEBKIT_DEBUG environment
    variable. Most of the settings will only give useful output for
    debug builds, but WEBKIT_DEBUG=Network will log all HTTP traffic
    form libsoup to console. See WebCore/platform/gtk/LoggingGtk.cpp
    for all the options available.
  - Lots of bugfixes.

================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.1
================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.1?

  - ABI compatibility with 1.0.3 was broken, so you will need to
    recompile your application against 1.1.1
  - Support for the CURL backend was dropped, libsoup is the only HTTP
    backend now.
  - webkit_get_default_session, to get the SoupSession used internally
    by WebKit.
  - 'create-web-view' signal, emitted when the creation of a new
    window is requested.
  - 'navigation-policy-decision-requested' signal, emitted when a
    navigation to another page is requested.
  - 'mime-type-policy-decision-requested' signal, emitted each time
    WebKit is about to show a URI with a given MIME type.
  - Support for the Web Inspector
    (see http://webkit.org/blog/197/web-inspector-redesign/)
  - HTTP authentication support, with optional gnome-keyring storage.
  - New load functions: webkit_web_view_open, webkit_web_view_load_uri
    and webkit_web_view_load_request. The old
    webkit_web_view_load_string and webkit_web_view_load_html_string
    are now deprecated.
  - webkit_web_view_reload_bypass_cache
  - webkit_web_view_{get,set}_custom_encoding, to override the
    encoding of the current page.
  - Improved stability and lots of bugfixes.
